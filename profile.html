            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <P>I spent the first 8 years of my career honing soft 
                business acumen skills in B2B client relations, managing client relationships through the
                complex lifecycles across a portfolio of products rooted in Higher Ed technology. In the past year, I have worked to grow my skillset into
                development and software engineering work as a result of time spent working directly with developers in designing, testing, and implementing
                products.
            </P>
            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <div>
                I would like to manage a mixed team of developers/engineers, marketing professionals, sales experts, and client success managers 
                to develop, maintain, improve, and implement an ever-evolving portfolio of industry-specific stacked skilling programs.<br>
                I want to further develop my understanding of the data ecosystem and architecture of my organization <br>
                I want to further develop my managerial acumen, coaching skills, and understanding of legal and ethical considerations in the
                development process.
